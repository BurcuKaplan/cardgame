This is the code for my CS102 class Homework #2.

This code was written in compliance with Bilkent Code Guidelines.

TASK: 
Design & implement a program to play a simple game of cards between four 
players. To begin, a full pck of cards are shuffles and dealt face-down to the
players. the game then proceeds in rounds. For each round, players play the 
top card from their hand and add it face-up to a pile on the table in front of
them. The player who plays the highest value card is the winner of the round
and their score is incremented by one. When all of the cards have been played,
player(s) with the highest score is declared the winner(s) of the game.
